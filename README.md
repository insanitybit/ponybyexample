# ponybyexample

Currently a work in progress - inspired heavily by the design and layout of
rustbyexample.com

The goal will be to get you started writing Pony code, introducing you to core
concepts and patterns along the way.

See [SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/insanitybit/ponybyexample/blob/master/src/SUMMARY.md) for current outline.
